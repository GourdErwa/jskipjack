# SkipJack #

Authors: Alexander Dean, Jonathan Johnson
Class: Cryptography (4003-482 - http://cs.rit.edu/~ark/482)

-- Description: --

For a class project our goal was to implement a cipher of our choice in 
whatever language we would like to. We chose the NIST's SkipJack Cipher,
particularly the standard 64-bit ECB cipher in java.

-- Usage: --

FastSkipJack <key> <plaintext_in_hex>
SkipJack <key> <plaintext_in_hex>

or file encryption with:

FastEncryptFile <key> <input_file> <output_file>
FastDecryptFile <key> <input_file> <output_file>

These two also have the option of running the slower version of SkipJack
by adding the option: EncryptFile and DecryptFile.
